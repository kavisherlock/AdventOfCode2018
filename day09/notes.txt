The first thing that was obvious here was to use a linked list, given the whole premise of the game involved inserting marbles between other marbles. Doing that in constant time was essential
After that, it was just playing the game. It took me a second to get used to using the iterators and the list insert/erase functions (especially coz by default, insert inserts the new element on the left). But once I got them working, the game played itself. Keeping track of scores was pretty easy
For part 2, the only change in the problem was the number of iterations. I was worries for a bit that my algorithm had some inefficiency that would cause it to take too long to run, but actually the only issue was that I was using regular int variables for everything. Changing that to a unsigned long long int solved that
