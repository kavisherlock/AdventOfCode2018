Part one was essentially a couple nested loops, one for each generation and one to apply the rules. The only tricky parts are knowing that the plantss go infintely in both directions, which means once you reach the end, you still theoretically have plants to the right. For that, I just had to add an if statement that if there is a plant in the last four spots, add two more to the string, since one of the rules can apply there. With that added the answer was simple to find
For part two, one thing was obvious that I can't just run the loop 50 billion times, since that's a ridiculous number. So I knew there was another trick to it. The solution, I found, was by printing a thousand generations and realising that after the first 100, the number of plants grow in a specific pattern. After 100 generations had gone by, each subsequent generation increased the number of plants by 5. So the answer was simple maths: the total after 101 generartions + (50 billion - 101) * 5
