This problem involved a lot of string manipulation. I'm quite used to JavaScript's convenient String functions like split, that it took a second to adjust to C++'s string library. But once I got used to the substr function, things got easier
In Part 1, it was basically using the string coordinates/dimensions of the rectangles and make a 2d array of the fabric and calculate the overlaps accordingly, by checking if the same spot is hit multiple times
Part 2 was a bit more tricky. When I wrote code to solve part 1, I wasn't concerned with WHO is claiming what area. Just how many claims on each point. Here, it was different. A slight change in the 2D array to save which elf owns what and keeping track of overlaps. In the end, there was only one that didn't, as the problem suggested
